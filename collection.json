It came so close\\nto something nameless. I needed the omnivorous\\nmetaphor, a golden omen. I needed to touch\\nits extreme beak with my mind, to know\\nit existed. That afternoon decades ago\\nwhen my mom went to Wal-Mart, the red poppies\\nran across her skirt, her eyes bluer than melting glaciers.\\nShe emerged with a bag, no explanation. And I drove\\nus back to the house my dad won by divorcing.\\nI don\u2019t remember how night descended, whether feathered\\nor furred, no poem-bird could hold it. Mom went inside\\nfirst. I stood near the pine and lied to love, lied to its face. I felt it\\nclosed. And there was Mom, in the window,\\nunwrapping her purchase. She set a chair near the socket,\\nplugged in her pen. I watched her blaze the pine-panel walls\\nwith a wood-burner. It wound round the rim of the room\\nand grew rounder, the part I didn\u2019t see coming.\\nYou will never forget me, Doru. No one else left\\ntheir homeland for you. Her hands shook, pressing\\nwords into the flesh of our home. The life she was\\nleaving. Her notes, that winding charred necklace,\\nencircling us. The bird was not black.\\nIt was the color of fire absent smoke.\\nI can\u2019t forget what it spoke.",

    "text": "When a bullet enters the brain, the head explodes.\\nI can think of no softer warning for the mothers\\nwho sit doubled before my desk,\\nknotting their smooth brown hands, \\nand begging, fix my boy, fix my boy.\\nHere's his high school picture.\\nAnd the smirking, mildly mustachioed player\\nin the crinkled snapshot\\nlooks nothing like the plastic bag of boy\\nstored and dated in the cold room downstairs. \\nIn the picture, he is cocky and chiseled,\\nclutching the world by the balls. I know the  look. \\nNow he is flaps of cheek, \\nslivers of jawbone, a surprised eye,\\nassorted teeth, bloody tufts of napped hair.\\nThe building blocks of my business.\\n\\nSo I swallow hard, turn the photo face down\\nand talk numbers instead. The high price\\nof miracles startles the still-young woman,\\nbut she is prepared. I know that she has sold\\neverything she owns, that cousins and uncles\\nhave emptied their empty bank accounts,\\nthat she dreams of her baby \\nin tuxedoed satin, flawless in an open casket,\\na cross or blood red rose tacked to his fingers,\\nhis halo set at a cocky angle.\\nI write a figure on a piece of paper\\nand push it across to her\\nwhile her chest heaves with hoping. \\nShe stares at the number, pulls in\\na slow weepy breath: \"Jesus.\"\\n\\nBut Jesus isn't on this payroll. I work alone\\nuntil the dim insistence of morning, \\nbent over my grisly puzzle pieces, gluing,\\nstitching, creating a chin with a brushstroke. \\nI plop glass eyes into rigid sockets,\\nthen carve eyelids from a forearm, an inner thigh.\\nI plump shattered skulls, and paint the skin\\nto suggest warmth, an impending breath.\\nI reach into collapsed cavities to rescue\\na tongue, an ear. Lips are never easy to recreate. \\n\\nAnd I try not to remember the stories, \\nthe tales the mothers must bring me\\nto ease their own hearts. Oh, they cry, \\nmy Ronnie, my Willie, my Michael, my Chico.\\nIt was self-defense. He was on his way home, \\na dark car slowed down, they must have thought\\nhe was someone else. He stepped between\\ntwo warring gang members at a party.\\nReally, he was trying to get off the streets, \\ntrying to pull away from the crowd. \\nHe was just trying to help a friend. \\nHe was in the wrong place at the wrong time. \\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bFix my boy; he was a good boy. Make him the way he was.\\n\\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bBut I have explored the jagged gaps\\nin the boy's body, smoothed the angry edges\\nof bulletholes. I have touched in in places\\nno mother knows, and I have birthed\\nhis new face. I know he believed himself\\ninvincible, that he most likely hissed\\n\"Fuck you, man\" before the bullets lifted him\\noff his feet. I try not to imagine\\nhis swagger, his lizard-lidded gaze,\\nhis young mother screaming into the phone.\\n\\nShe says she will find the money, and I know\\nthis is the truth that fuels her, forces her\\nto place one foot in front of the other. \\nSuddenly, I want to take her down\\nto the chilly room, open the bag\\nand shake its terrible bounty onto the \\ngleaming steel table. I want her to see him, \\nto touch him, to press her lips to the flap of cheek.\\nThe woman needs to wither, finally, and move on. \\n\\nWe both jump as the phone rattles in its hook. \\nI pray it's my wife, a bill collector, a wrong number.\\nBut the wide, questioning silence on the other end\\nis too familiar. Another mother needing a miracle. \\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bAnother homeboy coming home.",
